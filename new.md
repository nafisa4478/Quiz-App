defer:
1. Downloading the script(by adding defer the script will be loaded parallel with the page, the browser is going tp download it)
2. Executing the script only once everything is loaded up(when the document was read and the elements were available that is when the script is going to execute)
3. As it is in the head, the script will be seen lot quicker by the browser, so there might be a slight performance improvement.
4. semantically the script makes more more sense in the head because youu can keep up your body for your markup and your actual content.
5. It only works for external script

:root class:
1. pseudo class
2. It is used to define the variable in css
3. We can use these variables javascript itself
